# PlanGen Web üöÄ

An interactive web application that acts as an AI-powered planning layer for code generation, inspired by the vision of Traycer. This tool demonstrates a "Plan -> Approve -> Execute" workflow, putting the developer in control of AI-driven development.

## Core Concept

PlanGen isn't just another code generator. It's a strategic partner that helps deconstruct complex tasks into manageable steps, ensuring the developer understands and approves the path forward before any code is written. The workflow is simple and powerful:

1.  **Plan:** The user provides a high-level goal (e.g., "Create a React component with a counter"). The AI, acting as a software architect, breaks this down into a concrete, step-by-step plan.
2.  **Approve:** The generated plan is presented to the user in a clean UI. The developer can review the proposed changes and must explicitly approve them before the AI proceeds.
3.  **Execute:** Once approved, the AI, now acting as a developer, executes each step sequentially, generating the final code while providing a real-time log of its progress.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **AI-Powered Plan Generation:** Leverages the Google Gemini API to create logical development plans.
-   **Interactive Plan Review:** A clean, user-friendly interface for approving or rejecting the AI's proposed plan.
-   **Step-by-Step Execution:** Watch the AI work through the plan with a real-time execution log.
-   **Accordion UI:** A dynamic interface that collapses completed stages to keep the user focused on the current task.
-   **Copy to Clipboard:** Easily copy the final generated code.
-   **Dark Mode:** A sleek, persistent dark theme for a comfortable user experience.
-   **Modern UI:** Built with responsive components, loading states, and toast notifications for a smooth workflow.
